## What is Fedora?

Fedora is a Linux-based operating system created back in 2003 as a community distribution called the Fedora Project. 
The Fedora project is famous for being backed up by an ever-increasing community of both advanced and technically
inexperienced supporters from around the world who keep creating innovative free open-source software for Fedora users.
Moreover, all new features released by the Fedora community can be easily incorporated into any other Linux distribution.
This high productivity makes Fedora a 'factory' for free open-source software innovations where everyone could make a 
contribution as a volunteer worker.
