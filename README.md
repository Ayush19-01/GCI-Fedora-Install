Fedora is a Linux-based operating system created back in 2003 as a community distribution called the Fedora Project. 
The Fedora project is famous for being backed up by an ever-increasing community of both advanced and technically
inexperienced supporters from around the world who keep creating innovative free open-source software for Fedora users.
Moreover, all new features released by the Fedora community can be easily incorporated into any other Linux distribution.
This high productivity makes Fedora a 'factory' for free open-source software innovations where everyone could make a 
contribution as a volunteer worker.

Fedora Workstation 31 is the latest version of the fedora workstation series. It comes with new GNOME 3.34 which brings
some visual changes and performance improvements from it's previous versions.It is easier to change the background or 
lock screen wallpaper with GNOME 3.34, the options are user-friendly and useful.

# How to download and configure your PC for the installation
1. Click [here](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/) to download the latest fedora workstation.

2. Now, one would get two options to download from:

    1. MediaWriter
    
    2. ISO file
  
3. In this case, we have to download the ISO file.

4. After the downloading is complete we have to burn the ISO file on a bootable pendrive. To do that:
    
      1. First format the bootable pendrive(The size of the pendrive should be atleast 4GB)
      
      2. I used ISO to USB software to burn the files to USB, download ISO to USB from [here](http://www.softsea.com/download/ISO-to-USB.html).

      3. Install, launch ISO to USB and browse the Fedora workstation file and click burn. If your pendrive was not already 
      formatted it will formatted automatically.

5. After the ISO file is burnt on the pendrive, make an empty partition out of your current hard disk, the size can differ  
according to your needs, though 100-200 GB is recommended. To do that, type disk management on the search bar of windows and 
click on the first option. Here right click on the partition of your choice and click shrink volume. The space that is shrinked
becomes unallocated or free space, and that's what you want.

# Installing the latest Fedora Workstation

1. Now we have craeted the bootable pendrive with Fedora Workstation ISO image and an unallocated/free space.

2. Restart your computer and boot the pendrive, if booting pendrive is not enabled please enable it by opening bios of your PC.

3. After the pendrive boots, user gets two options, one to try fedora and one to install fedora on hard drive, click on the 
install on hard drive option.

4. After that it is very simple as the intsaller guides the user to choose it's preferences, like time zone, keyboard layout and
language.

5. Next, the installer asks the user to select a partition to install fedora on or let the installer choose the free space
by itself. I chose to let the installer configure the space by itself.

6. Fedora gets installed and asks the user to restart, after the restart you can use the Fedora Workstation.

7. The user selects language, sets username, password for that user.

8. A getting started screen appears which briefs the user about the usage of the OS.
